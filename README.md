# Keeper-Web-App

Note taking web app created with React.js

Run node app.js in CLI to run app

Through the note taking web app, users can easily create new entries by crafting a note that consists of both a title and content. Once a note is no longer necessary, it can be promptly deleted by using the designated button.

Developing this project was an enjoyable experience, as it allowed me to delve into a multitude of React topics, including components, useState, and props. In addition, it also served as a platform for me to reinforce my understanding of key JavaScript concepts such as object destructuring and event handling.
